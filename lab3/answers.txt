// sort1, sort2, and sort3 are binary files, so you wonâ€™t be able to view the C source code for each. We need to assess which sort implements which algorithm, run the sorts on different lists of values.

sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: this takes largest time in reversed and random txt files. so this is bubble sort

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: sort2 takes almost equal time to sort reversed50000.txt and sorted50000.txt and random50000.txt and is faster than other sorts.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: this takes almost 3 seconds in random50000 and reversed50000 and sorted50000.
